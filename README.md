## ⚙️ Environment Variables & API Keys

RAVEN23 uses `flutter_dotenv` to load environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

```env
# Required: TMDB API Key for movie and TV show metadata
TMDB_API_KEY="your_tmdb_api_key"

# Legacy: RAVEN23 Scraper API v2 instance URL (still used by current movie/TV screens during migration)
RAVEN23_API_URL="https://your-raven23-api-instance.com"

# Optional: Mixpanel project token for general analytics
MIXPANEL_API_KEY="your_mixpanel_api_key"
```

### Obtaining API Keys

- **TMDB API Key**: Register at [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/v3/reference/intro/authentication#api-key-quick-start) to get your free API key.
- **RAVEN23 Scraper API**: The scraper service is closed-source. For API access, self-hosting inquiries, or support, please use the existing legacy scraper support contact at [Email support](mailto:flixquestapp@gmail.com).
- **Mixpanel Token** _(Optional)_: Create a free account at [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com).

## 🧩 Unified Source Engine (migration in progress)

The new source foundation is being built inside RAVEN23 rather than as a
separate application. It introduces a shared media identity and stream contract,
OpenStream-style repository ingestion, per-source installation state, and a
first Stremio direct-stream engine. Each mirror remains a separate stream option
so equal-quality results can retain their own headers, audio labels, and
subtitle tracks.

Only enabled sources that are installed (or marked `installedByDefault`)
are eligible for lookup. A Stremio add-on added directly by its `manifest.json`
URL is treated as explicitly installed; other repository entries follow their
index's install-default flag and otherwise remain in the catalog until installed.
At this stage, Stremio direct HTTP(S) streams are executable. Other
OpenStream engine families and Zangetsu JavaScript/QuickJS providers are kept as
catalog metadata until their corresponding isolated runtimes are implemented.
The existing movie/episode screens and player are still on the legacy path; the
migration status and next integration steps are documented in
[`docs/unified-source-engine/PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md`](docs/unified-source-engine/PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md).

---

## 🕷️ Legacy RAVEN23 Scraper API v2

The current movie and TV loading screens still use **RAVEN23 Scraper API v2** while the unified source engine is being introduced. The backend service is closed-source; please use the existing legacy scraper support contact at [Email support](mailto:flixquestapp@gmail.com) for support or API instance access. The new repository and Stremio source foundation is documented in [`docs/unified-source-engine/PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md`](docs/unified-source-engine/PHASE_0_1_STATUS.md). Do not remove `RAVEN23_API_URL` until the movie/TV screens have been migrated and remaining Live TV or auxiliary API dependencies have been separated.

The client-side API contract and payload schemas are documented in [`openapi.json`](openapi.json).

Key endpoints consumed by the app:

- `GET /providers`: Discovers available and enabled video providers.
- `GET /providers/status`: Fetches live provider health status, latency, and uptime.
- `GET /stream-movie`: Scrapes streaming links for movies using TMDB ID.
- `GET /stream-tv`: Scrapes streaming links for TV episodes using TMDB ID, season, and episode number.
- `GET /subtitles/search`: Searches every subtitle provider for a movie or episode and returns one combined catalog.
- `GET /subtitles/{provider}/{id}`: Downloads a subtitle file. The API converts and re-encodes it, so the app never contacts a subtitle host directly.
- `POST /stream-size`: Estimates the byte size behind a stream token so the quality picker can show sizes.
- `GET /api/v2/intro`: Retrieves branded intro video configuration.

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration

RAVEN23 uses Firebase for several services:

| Service                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## ▶️ Custom `better_player` Package

This repository uses the customized `better_player_plus` package maintained as an external customized BetterPlayer dependency at [the upstream package repository](https://github.com/BeamlakAschalew/flixquest-betterplayer). The dependency is configured to use its `main` branch in `pubspec.yaml`, so a separate sibling checkout is not required. It requires Flutter 3.35+ and Dart 3.9+. Run `flutter pub get` after cloning or downloading this project to resolve the Git dependency.

For offline development, the package can still be checked out beside this repository and the dependency changed to a local `path` override.

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started & Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: `>=3.35.0`
- **Dart SDK**: `>=3.9.0 <4.0.0`
- **Android SDK / NDK**: Android SDK 34+, Java 17

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BeamlakAschalew/raven23.git
   cd raven23
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env # or create a new .env file with your keys
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - For Android Mobile / Tablet:

     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

   - For Android TV (Emulator or connected TV device):

     ```bash
     flutter run -d <tv-device-id>
     ```

   The app detects TV or mobile mode automatically by default. If a custom ROM
   reports the wrong device type, choose **Settings → Appearance → App mode →
   TV** or **Mobile**. The interface switches immediately and the choice is saved
   across launches. Choose **Automatic** to return to device detection.

   Android has two flavors: `prod` (the default) and `dev`. To test real banner
   ads using Firebase's `banner_ad_network_test` selector, run the dev flavor:

   ```bash
   flutter run --flavor dev
   flutter run --flavor dev --release
   ```

   The test selector works in dev debug/profile/release builds. Prod ignores it
   in every build mode. See [banner testing setup](docs/firebase_remote_config.md#test-real-banners-in-development).
   Both flavors reuse the existing Android package and Firebase registration;
   they share an install slot. The dev launcher label is **RAVEN23 Dev**.

5. **Build Release APK**:

   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release
   ```

   This uses the default `prod` flavor and outputs
   `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-prod-release.apk`. You can also specify
   `--flavor prod` explicitly. A development release APK is built with
   `flutter build apk --flavor dev --release`.

   For smaller per-device downloads, also build split APKs:

   ```bash
   flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
   ```

   The update screen downloads the APK matching the device's CPU. Publish each
   split APK's link in Remote Config under `app_download_url_arm64_v8a`,
   `app_download_url_armeabi_v7a` and `app_download_url_x86_64`, and keep the
   universal APK in `app_download_url`. A device whose ABI can't be read, or
   whose key is empty, downloads the universal APK.
