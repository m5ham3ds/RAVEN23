The 'android' binary can also be found in the cmdline-tools directory, and 'android sdk' is the replacement for 'sdkmanager'.
To learn more about the Android CLI and how to use it, see the documentation (https://d.android.com/tools/agents/android-cli)

- Flavor: `prod`; target: `lib/main.dart`.
- ABI target: `android-arm64` (expected APK ABI: `arm64-v8a` only).
- Build defines: `ENABLE_FIREBASE=false`, `LOCAL_DEV_MODE=true`.

### Run context

## 4. Commands and build switches

- Dependency resolution: `flutter pub get`.
- Formatting: scoped Manga/Home/Anime/Mihon, PHASE63 work-detail/reader/translation and mobile navigation Dart targets via `bash tool/format_phase57_dart.sh --fix` / `--check` (63 files).
- Static analysis: `flutter analyze --no-fatal-infos`; it starts only after dependency resolution and formatting succeed.
- Required pre-build tests: fifteen focused Manga/Home/Anime/Mihon/mobile-navigation/reader Flutter test files, including PHASE62 Manga details/reader-source persistence tests, and one Android `MihonExtensionLoaderAbiTest` class (three ABI boundary cases). Other Flutter and Android test sources remain preserved for owner-led manual/deeper regression; they are not all part of the routine APK gate. Dedicated PHASE52/53 test files remain retired after owner-confirmed acceptance.
- Live Laravel smoke/E2E tests are not pre-build gates; their source files are preserved for explicit manual/staging validation after APK creation. The write-enabled E2E test still requires a disposable staging backend and explicit write consent.
- Wrapper generation: `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 8.14 --distribution-type all`.
- APK build: `flutter build apk --${BUILD_MODE} --flavor prod --target lib/main.dart --target-platform android-arm64 -Pdisable-abi-filtering=true --dart-define=ENABLE_FIREBASE=false --dart-define=LOCAL_DEV_MODE=true`.
- APK audit: inspect archive CRC/listing, native ABI directories, package name and payload sizes.

### Routine pre-build test gate

```text

    Routine pre-build Flutter gate runs exactly these fifteen files:

    test/manga/manga_repository_manager_test.dart
    --covers: first-use seed, add/edit/remove, HTTP(S) .pb validation,
              fragment normalization, duplicate prevention and stale updates
    test/manga/manga_reader_crop_test.dart
    --covers: flat scan-margin detection, untouched artwork and invalid input safety
    test/manga/mihon_source_browser_screen_test.dart
    --covers: unified available/installed extension directory, screenshot-matched row actions, orphaned installed sources and removal support
    test/manga/mihon_default_extension_installer_test.dart
    --covers: exact ten-name selection, pinned Keiyoushi signing fingerprint, Arabic package preference and strict name normalization
    test/manga/phase55_manga_catalogue_test.dart
    --covers: All/JP/KR/CN filters, title metadata and catalogue shelves
    test/manga/phase55_mihon_pb_index_test.dart
    test/manga/phase56_manga_regression_test.dart
    --covers: gzip Protobuf decoding, extension mapping, raw repo.json parsing, strict signer trust and install eligibility
    test/manga/phase57_manga_home_parity_test.dart
    --covers: every Manga/Manhwa/Manhua catalogue shelf survives aggregation
    test/manga_detail_metadata_test.dart
    --covers: AniList detail metadata, characters/staff, relations, tags and optional-field fallbacks
    test/manga_reading_store_test.dart
    --covers: source pins, chapter progress, reading status and per-work reader preferences
    test/manga_source_matcher_test.dart
    --covers: strict whole-title matching, aliases and chapter-number parsing
    test/mobile/mobile_nav_bar_test.dart
    --covers: Phosphor destination icons and selected-destination menu-toggle transitions
    test/anime_media_classification_test.dart
    --covers: Japanese animation is Anime; non-Japanese Animation and Japanese live action are not
    test/home_catalog_test.dart
    --covers: Anime and Series Continue Watching remain isolated
    test/home_screen_test.dart
    --covers: Anime feed uses Home rows; Anime stays out of Series; Manga All aggregation, Skeleton and See All behavior

    Android gate: `:app:testProdReleaseUnitTest --tests com.m5ham3ds.raven23.mihon.MihonExtensionLoaderAbiTest`
    --covers: Float widening (1.6f), exact supported versions (1.4/1.6), and unsupported/non-finite values

    All other test sources remain in the repository for manual/deeper regression; CI does not delete or disable them.
    
```

### Warning and deprecation excerpts

- **Flutter analyze:** `info • 'translate' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use translateByVector3, translateByVector4, or translateByDouble instead • lib/manga/ui/manga_reader_screen.dart:2409:9 • deprecated_member_use`
- **Flutter analyze:** `info • 'scale' is deprecated and shouldn't be used. Use scaleByVector3, scaleByVector4, or scaleByDouble instead • lib/manga/ui/manga_reader_screen.dart:2410:9 • deprecated_member_use`

### Notices

- No notice markers found in captured command logs.

### Error and failure excerpts

- **Flutter analyze:** `error • Undefined name 'utf8' • lib/manga/ui/manga_reader_screen.dart:1352:33 • undefined_identifier`

## 8. Interpretation notes

- A step marked `skipped` was not executed; this includes later build stages blocked by a prerequisite failure and must not be interpreted as a pass.
- The routine APK gate intentionally runs fifteen focused Manga/Home/Anime/Mihon/mobile-navigation/reader Flutter files and the three-case Android Mihon ABI class. The full Flutter and Android test inventories remain untouched in the source tree for manual/deeper regression after the owner installs the APK. Laravel live tests are also retained for explicit staging validation and are not pre-build gates.
- Setup actions (checkout/tool installers/cache) expose their detailed output in the linked GitHub Actions run; their success/failure outcome is recorded above.
- This report describes this individual run only. It does not mark a RAVEN23 phase accepted unless all required CI and runtime acceptance gates pass.
