# PHASE 9 — OpenStream Web Embed Kotlin compile fix

See `docs/build-reports/2026-11-02-openstream-web-embed-kotlin-nullability-fix.md` for the reported error, exact correction, scope and verification limits.

The only source change in this phase is `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/m5ham3ds/raven23/streaming/OpenStreamWebEmbedBridge.kt`: normalize the validated nullable `Uri.host` into a non-null `String`, and use that for default Referer/source-name values. No playback-engine behavior or provider logic was changed.
